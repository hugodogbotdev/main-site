                 <h2>Your here!</h2>
                 <p>We are very glad you have made it here to the new and improved hugo development web page, this has taken our team a good while to get up and running so we do hope you enjoy using this page and all its features!</p>
                 <p>With our new site comes alot of new possibilities and we hope you use them to their full extent but with the good news here comes the bad, our old and first official site will be shutting down for good as this site will be taking its spot :(.</p>
